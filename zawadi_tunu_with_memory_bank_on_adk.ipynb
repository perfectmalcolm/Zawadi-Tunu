Built as a demonstration of the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Gemini and the Vertex AI Memory Bank, this agent's core strength lies in its ability to retain and recall nuanced information over time.\n",

            "*   **Doll or Stuffed Animal with Accessories:** A baby doll with a small carrier, bottle, or extra outfit encourages nurturing play.\n",
            "*   **Animal Figures or Vehicle Sets:** A collection of farm animals, zoo animals, construction vehicles, or trains allows for building imaginative worlds.\n",

            "\n",
            "**1. Creative & Art Supplies:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Play-Doh Set:** Great for fine motor skills, imagination, and sensory play. Look for sets with tools like cutters, rollers, or simple extruders.\n",
            "*   **Jumbo Crayons, Washable Markers, or Finger Paints:** Large sizes are easier for small hands to grasp. Washable is key for parents! Pair with a large pad of paper or a tabletop easel.\n",
            "*   **Water Wow! Books (Melissa & Doug):** These are fantastic for mess-free \"painting\" with water. The colors magically appear and then disappear as it dries, so they can be used again and again.\n",
            "*   **Simple Craft Kits:** Look for kits with large pieces, like sticker scenes, foam art, or chunky bead stringing sets (with adult supervision).\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Imaginative & Pretend Play:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** A simple set of princess, superhero, doctor, chef, or animal costumes can spark hours of role-playing fun.\n",
            "*   **Play Kitchen & Food:** A classic for a reason! Kids love to mimic adults. Look for wooden or sturdy plastic sets.\n",
            "*   **Doll or Stuffed Animal with Accessories:** A baby doll with a small carrier, bottle, or extra outfit encourages nurturing play.\n",
            "*   **Animal Figures or Vehicle Sets:** A collection of farm animals, zoo animals, construction vehicles, or trains allows for building imaginative worlds.\n",
            "*   **Doctor Kit:** Helps kids understand and process visits to the doctor in a playful way.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Building & Construction:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **DUPLO Blocks (LEGO Duplo):** Larger than regular LEGOs, they are perfect for small hands to connect and disconnect, building towers, houses, and more.\n",
            "*   **Mega Bloks:** Similar to DUPLO, these large, chunky blocks are easy to handle and encourage creative construction.\n",
            "*   **Wooden Building Blocks:** Timeless and versatile, these blocks can be stacked, sorted, and used in countless ways.\n",

            "**5. Outdoor & Active Play:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** If she doesn't have one, a tricycle or a balance bike is excellent for gross motor development and getting outdoors.\n",
            "*   **Ball Set:** A soft ball, a bouncy ball, or a set of different sized balls can provide endless fun.\n",
            "*   **Bubble Machine or Giant Bubble Wand:** Who doesn't love bubbles?!\n",
            "*   **Sand Toys:** If she has a sandbox or goes to the beach, a new set of buckets, shovels, and molds is always a hit.\n",

            "    *   **Lightweight:** Most are designed to be light enough for a child to easily maneuver.\n",
            "*   **Key Features to Look For:**\n",
            "    *   **Adjustable Seat and Handlebars:** Essential for ensuring a proper fit and allowing the bike to grow with the child. Her feet should be able to touch the ground flat-footed when seated.\n",
            "    *   **Lightweight Frame:** Easier for her to control and for parents to carry if she gets tired.\n",
            "    *   **Durable Tires:** Air-filled (pneumatic) tires offer better traction and a smoother ride than foam/plastic tires, especially outdoors.\n",
            "    *   **Footrests (Optional):** Some balance bikes have small footrests where children can place their feet once they've mastered gliding.\n",

              "   \n",
              "   *   **Play-Doh Set:** Great for fine motor skills, imagination, and sensory play. Look for sets with tools like cutters, rollers, or simple extruders.\n",
              "   *   **Jumbo Crayons, Washable Markers, or Finger Paints:** Large sizes are easier for small hands to grasp. Washable is key for parents! Pair with a large pad of paper or a tabletop easel.\n",
              "   *   **Water Wow! Books (Melissa & Doug):** These are fantastic for mess-free \"painting\" with water. The colors magically appear and then disappear as it dries, so they can be used again and again.\n",
              "   *   **Simple Craft Kits:** Look for kits with large pieces, like sticker scenes, foam art, or chunky bead stringing sets (with adult supervision).\n",

              "   **2. Imaginative & Pretend Play:**\n",

              "   *   **Doll or Stuffed Animal with Accessories:** A baby doll with a small carrier, bottle, or extra outfit encourages nurturing play.\n",
              "   *   **Animal Figures or Vehicle Sets:** A collection of farm animals, zoo animals, construction vehicles, or trains allows for building imaginative worlds.\n",
              "   *   **Doctor Kit:** Helps kids understand and process visits to the doctor in a playful way.\n",
              "   \n",

              "   \n",
              "   *   **DUPLO Blocks (LEGO Duplo):** Larger than regular LEGOs, they are perfect for small hands to connect and disconnect, building towers, houses, and more.\n",
              "   *   **Mega Bloks:** Similar to DUPLO, these large, chunky blocks are easy to handle and encourage creative construction.\n",
              "   *   **Wooden Building Blocks:** Timeless and versatile, these blocks can be stacked, sorted, and used in countless ways.\n",

              "   \n",
              "   *   **Picture Books:** Three-year-olds enjoy engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Look for books with rhyming, lift-the-flaps, or interactive elements.\n",
              "   *   **Simple Puzzles:** Wooden knob puzzles (shapes, animals), chunky jigsaw puzzles (12-24 pieces), or floor puzzles are great for problem-solving and fine motor skills.\n",
              "   *   **Shape Sorters or Stacking Toys:** Reinforce basic concepts like shapes, colors, and sizes.\n",
              "   *   **Matching Games:** Simple \"memory\" or matching games with large, colorful cards.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **5. Outdoor & Active Play:**\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** If she doesn't have one, a tricycle or a balance bike is excellent for gross motor development and getting outdoors.\n",
              "   *   **Ball Set:** A soft ball, a bouncy ball, or a set of different sized balls can provide endless fun.\n",
              "   *   **Bubble Machine or Giant Bubble Wand:** Who doesn't love bubbles?!\n",
              "   *   **Sand Toys:** If she has a sandbox or goes to the beach, a new set of buckets, shovels, and molds is always a hit.\n",

              "   **General Tips:**\n",
              "   \n",

              "   *   **Ask the parents:** They know best what she already has, what she needs, and if there's anything they'd prefer to avoid (e.g., overly noisy toys).\n",
              "   *   **Durability & Safety:** Choose well-made toys that will withstand toddler play and are free from small parts that could be choking hazards.\n",

              "   \n",
              "   *   **What they are:** Balance bikes are two-wheeled bikes without pedals. Children sit on the seat and propel themselves by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
              "   *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
              "       *   **Focus on Balance First:** This is their biggest advantage. Kids learn to balance and steer naturally without the added complexity of pedaling. This makes the transition to a pedal bike much easier later on, often skipping training wheels entirely.\n",
              "       *   **Develops Confidence:** Children feel more in control because their feet are always close to the ground.\n",
              "       *   **Gross Motor Skills:** Excellent for developing coordination, agility, and spatial awareness.\n",
              "       *   **Lightweight:** Most are designed to be light enough for a child to easily maneuver.\n",
              "   *   **Key Features to Look For:**\n",
              "       *   **Adjustable Seat and Handlebars:** Essential for ensuring a proper fit and allowing the bike to grow with the child. Her feet should be able to touch the ground flat-footed when seated.\n",
              "       *   **Lightweight Frame:** Easier for her to control and for parents to carry if she gets tired.\n",
              "       *   **Durable Tires:** Air-filled (pneumatic) tires offer better traction and a smoother ride than foam/plastic tires, especially outdoors.\n",
              "       *   **Footrests (Optional):** Some balance bikes have small footrests where children can place their feet once they've mastered gliding.\n",
              "   *   **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Cruzee, Banwood, Joovy.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   ### 2. Tricycles\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **What they are:** Three-wheeled bikes that offer a lot of stability.\n",
              "   *   **Why they're good for 3-year-olds:**\n",
              "       *   **Stability:** They are very stable, which can be reassuring for hesitant riders.\n",
              "       *   **Early Pedaling Practice:** They allow children to practice pedaling motions before they need to balance.\n",
              "       *   **Often have Parent Push Handles:** Many tricycles for this age come with a handle that parents can use to push and steer, acting like a stroller for a while.\n",
              "   *   **Considerations:**\n",
              "       *   **Doesn't Teach Balance:** The main drawback is that they don't help with balance, meaning a child will still need to learn that skill separately when transitioning to a two-wheeled pedal bike.\n",
              "       *   **Can Be Cumbersome:** They can be heavier and less agile than balance bikes.\n",
              "   *   **Types:** Look for sturdy models. Some even convert from a push trike to a free-pedal trike.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   ### 3. Bikes with Training Wheels (Less Common for 3-year-olds now)\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **What they are:** Traditional two-wheeled pedal bikes with two small wheels attached to the rear axle for stability.\n",
              "   *   **Why they *might* be considered:** Some parents prefer this traditional route.\n",
              "   *   **Considerations for a 3-year-old:**\n",
              "       *   **Sizing:** Finding a pedal bike small enough for a 3-year-old can be challenging. A 12-inch wheel size is typically the smallest, and even that might be too large for some 3-year-olds. Her feet need to comfortably reach the pedals and the ground.\n",
              "       *   **Doesn't Teach Balance Well:** Training wheels prop the bike up, preventing the child from learning to balance naturally. This often results in a wobbly, dependent ride.\n",
              "       *   **Can Be Heavier:** Pedal bikes with training wheels are generally heavier than balance bikes.\n",
              "       *   **Less Recommended:** Most experts and parents who have used balance bikes will recommend a balance bike first, as it makes the transition to a pedal bike much smoother and faster without training wheels.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   ### Sizing for a 3-Year-Old\n",
              "   \n",
              "   The most important measurement for a bike is the **inseam (crotch to floor)**, not the child's age or height.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **For Balance Bikes:** When seated, her feet should be flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee. This allows her to push off comfortably and quickly put her feet down.\n",
              "   *   **For Pedal Bikes (with or without training wheels):** When seated, her feet should be able to reach the pedals at their lowest point, and she should be able to touch the ground with her toes or balls of her feet.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   ### Don't Forget Safety Gear!\n",
              "   \n",
              "   No matter which bike you choose, a properly fitting **helmet** is absolutely essential. Make sure it meets safety standards (like CPSC in the US) and fits snugly.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **Recommendation:**\n",
              "   \n",
              "   For a 3-year-old, a **balance bike** is usually the top recommendation by far.

            "Agent Response:  That's a lovely idea! Dolls are wonderful for encouraging imaginative play, nurturing, and developing social-emotional skills in three-year-olds.\n",
            "\n",
            "For a three-year-old, you'll want something that is durable, easy for them to manage, and safe. Here are some types of dolls that are generally great for her age:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Soft-Bodied Baby Dolls:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are often the first choice for this age. They are soft and cuddly, perfect for hugging and comforting. Many come with simple outfits that are easy for little hands to put on and take off (great for developing fine motor skills). They encourage nurturing play, like feeding, rocking, and putting to bed.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Dolls with soft, washable bodies and simple, chunky clothing. Brands like Cabbage Patch Kids (the soft-bodied versions), Melissa & Doug, or smaller baby doll lines are popular.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Toddler Dolls (like some \"My First\" dolls):**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are often slightly larger than baby dolls but still manageable. They might have a bit more articulation (moveable arms/legs) and a wider range of clothing options. They can be good for slightly more complex pretend play scenarios.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Dolls that are still relatively soft, or made from durable, child-friendly plastic. Avoid dolls with tiny accessories or intricate hair that will tangle easily. \"My First Princess\" dolls from brands like Disney often fit this category, as they usually have simpler outfits and fewer small parts than the collector versions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Doll with Easy-to-Manage Hair:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** At three, many children enjoy brushing and styling a doll's hair. Look for dolls with rooted hair that isn't too long or fine, making it less prone to tangling and easier for little fingers to brush.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Hair that feels thick and securely rooted. Some dolls come with a simple brush.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Simple Rag Dolls:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are classic, timeless, and incredibly cuddly. They are usually very durable, machine washable, and have soft, friendly faces. They are great for quiet play and bedtime snuggles.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Well-made rag dolls with embroidered features (no small buttons for eyes, etc.) and sturdy stitching.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Things to consider and avoid:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Size:** Make sure the doll isn't too big or heavy for her to carry comfortably.\n",
            "*   **Small Parts:** Absolutely avoid dolls with tiny shoes, hair accessories, or other small detachable parts that could be a choking hazard. Check age recommendations carefully.\n",
            "*   **Complex Electronics:** While some dolls talk or sing, too many complex features can sometimes limit imaginative play. A simple doll leaves more room for her to create her own stories.\n",
            "*   **Hair Quality:** Avoid dolls with very thin, wispy hair that knots and frizzes instantly, as it can be frustrating for a three-year-old.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many brands like **Corolle, Melissa & Doug, Manhattan Toy Company, HABA,** or even generic **soft baby dolls** you might find at toy stores, offer excellent options for this age group. If you can, opt for a doll with a friendly, welcoming expression.\n",
            "\n",
            "Happy shopping! She'll love whatever you choose.\n"

Interactive books (lift-the-flap, touch-and-feel) are also popular.\\n    *   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Simple 4-6 piece puzzles with knobs are great for developing problem-solving skills.\\n\\n5.  **Musical Instruments:**\\n    *   **Child-friendly instruments:** A toy keyboard, tambourine, or shakers can introduce her to music.\\n\\nThink about what she's currently interested in, whether it's animals, vehicles, princesses, or creating things, and that might help narrow down the perfect gift!\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

Here are some types of dolls that are generally great for her age:\\n\\n1.  **Soft-Bodied Baby Dolls:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are often the first choice for this age. They are soft and cuddly, perfect for hugging and comforting. Many come with simple outfits that are easy for little hands to put on and take off (great for developing fine motor skills). They encourage nurturing play, like feeding, rocking, and putting to bed.\\n    *   **Look for:** Dolls with soft, washable bodies and simple, chunky clothing. Brands like Cabbage Patch Kids (the soft-bodied versions), Melissa & Doug, or smaller baby doll lines are popular.\\n\\n2.  **Toddler Dolls (like some \\\"My First\\\" dolls):**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are often slightly larger than baby dolls but still manageable. They might have a bit more articulation (moveable arms/legs) and a wider range of clothing options. They can be good for slightly more complex pretend play scenarios.\\n    *   **Look for:** Dolls that are still relatively soft, or made from durable, child-friendly plastic. Avoid dolls with tiny accessories or intricate hair that will tangle easily. \\\"My First Princess\\\" dolls from brands like Disney often fit this category, as they usually have simpler outfits and fewer small parts than the collector versions.\\n\\n3.  **Doll with Easy-to-Manage Hair:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** At three, many children enjoy brushing and styling a doll's hair. Look for dolls with rooted hair that isn't too long or fine, making it less prone to tangling and easier for little fingers to brush.\\n    *   **Look for:** Hair that feels thick and securely rooted. Some dolls come with a simple brush.\\n\\n4.  **Simple Rag Dolls:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are classic, timeless, and incredibly cuddly. They are usually very durable, machine washable, and have soft, friendly faces. They are great for quiet play and bedtime snuggles.\\n    *   **Look for:** Well-made rag dolls with embroidered features (no small buttons for eyes, etc.) and sturdy stitching.\\n\\n**Things to consider and avoid:**\\n\\n*   **Size:** Make sure the doll isn't too big or heavy for her to carry comfortably.\\n*   **Small Parts:** Absolutely avoid dolls with tiny shoes, hair accessories, or other small detachable parts that could be a choking hazard. Check age recommendations carefully.\\n*   **Complex Electronics:** While some dolls talk or sing, too many complex features can sometimes limit imaginative play. A simple doll leaves more room for her to create her own stories.\\n*   **Hair Quality:** Avoid dolls with very thin, wispy hair that knots and frizzes instantly, as it can be frustrating for a three-year-old.\\n\\nMany brands like **Corolle, Melissa & Doug, Manhattan Toy Company, HABA,** or even generic **soft baby dolls** you might find at toy stores, offer excellent options for this age group. If you can, opt for a doll with a friendly, welcoming expression.\\n\\nHappy shopping! She'll love whatever you choose.\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",
